# iron-pastebin
CLI pastebin clone built on the Iron framework for Rust

I was intrigued by the [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) web framework for Rust, but found it lacking in many regards.
I took the opportunity to run through Rocket's [tutorial app](https://rocket.rs/guide/pastebin/) in Iron instead.
I found this a far better experience.
